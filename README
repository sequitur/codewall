A web toy/art project that turns code into *a e s t h e t i c* by syntax
highlighting it then rendering it in WebGL with a stack of postprocessing
effects. All front-end; requires no server software.

A working version of this is hosted at brunodias.space/misc/codewall.

## Hacking this

Clone the git repository and do `npm install` as you might expect. `npm start`
will run a live server and watch the relevant files for modifications. `npm
run build` will build it.
